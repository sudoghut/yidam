# Yidam

Yidam is a project that provides a LAN-based LLM chat interface for smartphone users via your server. It is built with Rust, leveraging its capabilities to handle HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, and JSON processing. Users can access the chat service by scanning a QR code generated by the server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that **Rust** and **Cargo** are installed on your machine. If not, you can install them from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the Yidam project repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sudoghut/yidam.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd yidam
```

### Running the Project

To start the server, execute:

```sh
cargo run
```

### Accessing the Chat Interface

Once the project is running, it will generate a QR code for users. Scanning this code with a smartphone will load the chat interface. For instance, if your server is hosted locally, the URL might look like:

```
http://192.168.86.93:3001/web
```

### Smartphone Integration

After scanning the QR code, users can access and interact with the chat interface directly on their smartphones.

## Project Structure

- **`main.rs`**: The main entry point of the application, responsible for setting up the server and handling incoming requests.  
- **`web/`**: Contains static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served by the application.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following Rust crates:  

- **`reqwest`**: For making HTTP requests  
- **`tokio`**: For asynchronous runtime  
- **`serde_json`**: For JSON serialization and deserialization  
- **`axum`**: For building web applications  
- **`futures`**: For asynchronous programming  
- **`tower-http`**: For HTTP utilities
